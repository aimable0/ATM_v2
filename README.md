# üèß ATM Simulator in C

## Problem Statement

This project is a simple **ATM simulator written in C**.
It allows multiple users to log in with a username and pincode, and perform standard ATM operations:

- Deposit money
- Withdraw money
- Check account balance
- View transaction history (last 5 actions are saved)
- Logout (clears transactions and resets session)

This program demonstrates **structs, arrays, strings, input validation, and functions** in C.

## Features

- **Login system** with predefined users and pincodes
- **Deposit & Withdraw** with balance updates and validation
- **Balance inquiry** with formatted output
- **Transaction history** (capped at 5 recent actions)
- **Logout** resets session data
- **Error handling** for invalid inputs and insufficient funds

---

## üöÄ Usage

1. Compile the program

Make sure you have GCC installed, then compile with:

```sh
gcc atm.c -o atm

2. Run The program
./atm

3. Login credentials
Username. Pincode
karake.    0001
simeon.    0002
manzi.     0003
levis.     0004

4.Sample Run

-------- LOG IN ---------
Enter username (q to quit): karake
Enter pincode: 0001

Hello, karake!

============ ATM (SIMULATOR) ===========

Choose:
  (1) Deposit Money
  (2) Check Account Balance
  (3) Withdraw Money
  (4) Transaction history
  (5) Logout

(prompt) Choose action [1-4]: 1

$$ Enter amount to deposit: 100
++ $100.00 deposited successfully!

(prompt) Choose action [1-4]: 2

$$ Current Balance: $100.00

(prompt) Choose action [1-4]: 3

$$ Enter amount to withdraw: 40
-- Withdrawal of $40.00 successful.

$$ Current Balance: $60.00

(prompt) Choose action [1-4]: 4

------- Transaction History ---------
1. Deposited $100.00
2. Checked balance $0.00
3. Withdrew $40.00

(prompt) Choose action [1-4]: 5

... Goodbye! Thanks for using ATM Simulator ...


üèóÔ∏è Design Notes

Program Flow
1. User enters username (or quits with q).
2. Pincode is validated.
3. If valid ‚Üí access to ATM menu.
4. ATM menu allows deposit, withdraw, check balance, or view history.
5. Logout clears transactions and returns to login screen.

Key Functions
‚Ä¢ check_balance(balance) ‚Üí Display balance
‚Ä¢ deposit(current_balance, amount) ‚Üí Add funds
‚Ä¢ withdraw(current_balance, amount) ‚Üí Withdraw funds if sufficient
‚Ä¢ viewTransactions() ‚Üí Display transaction history
‚Ä¢ logTransaction(action) ‚Üí Save an action in the rolling log
‚Ä¢ clearTransactions() ‚Üí Reset history after logout

Transaction History
‚Ä¢ Stores up to 5 actions (deposit, withdraw, check balance).
‚Ä¢ Oldest transaction is discarded when limit is reached.

üìö Extra notes:

Through this project, we've practiced:
‚Ä¢ C fundamentals (loops, conditionals, arrays, functions)
‚Ä¢ Structs for modeling user accounts
‚Ä¢ String manipulation with strcpy, strcmp, sprintf
‚Ä¢ Input handling & validation
‚Ä¢ Designing a menu-driven program


### Conclusion:

This ATM simulator is a simple, interactive project showcasing how C can be used to model real-world systems.
It‚Äôs ideal for beginners learning C programming and practicing program design, user input handling, and data storage in memory.
